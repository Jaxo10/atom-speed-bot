# speed-bot

This is a simple package to help you improve your javascript coding speed. It completes statements intelligently depending on the environment.
For those accustomed to JetBrains products it will immediately feel familiar.

## Usage
Just press **Ctrl/CMD + ;** to invoke

##Features
* complete assignments e.g. `var = "asdf";`
* complete if statements intelligently
* complete function assignments intelligently e.g. `function (blabla)`
* complete arrow functions. invocation must be after `() =>`

##Disclaimer
While this package should be working, it is still under construction and is only published now to reserve that awesome name ;)
If the hotkeys are not working correctly on all platforms you might have to set them manually
